# My-first-html-and-css-project
This is my first ever project after completing html and css. I made this website with the help of a youtube channel called "Easy Tutorial". There are some flaws in this project but i think it's pretty good for my first ever project. To access this project you have to download all the files in the same folder after that open "index.html" file. After that you can pretty much see everything about this project. This project only contains html and css.
